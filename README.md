# IT Workshop Backend

This repository hosts the backend code for an IT workshop web application, developed using Python FastAPI and MongoDB. The project leverages both Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and structured programming techniques to maintain clear, modular, and efficient code. The backend is designed to be highly readable and easily manageable, enabling quick updates and scalability.
